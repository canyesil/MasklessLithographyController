Basic Maskless lithography controller which consists of two parts, i.e.,

i)  usb-serial device including micro stage and UV laser driver circuits (Arduino Uno used in the prototype) 

ii) Platform independent controller interface based on Wolfram, Mathematica

The whole project is still under development.

Now, there is only the first version of the controller interface and the basic C code for Arduino.
